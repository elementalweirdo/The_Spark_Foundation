Internship Task 3
Prediction using Decision Tree 
Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)
● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it 
graphically. 
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly.
