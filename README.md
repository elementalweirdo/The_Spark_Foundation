Internship Task 2
Problem Statement:
Prediction using Unsupervised ML
(Level - Beginner)
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and 
represent it visually. 
● Use R or Python or perform this task
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j


Internship Task 3
Prediction using Decision Tree 
Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)
● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it 
graphically. 
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly. 
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Internship Task 4
Stock Market Prediction using 
Numerical and Textual Analysis
(Level - Advanced)
● Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using 
numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis 
of news headlines 
● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com
● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then 
combine the findings to create a hybrid model.
